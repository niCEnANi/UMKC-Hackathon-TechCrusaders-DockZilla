•Using this application we can analyze various types of documents like text documents, video files and images. 
•This application also provides sentiment analysis for text documents and recognizes the prominent celebrities from the images which is pretty cool.
•We have used different techonlogies like CSS, Javascript (libraries like Angular and jQuery), HTML, Bootstrap, RESTful APIs.
